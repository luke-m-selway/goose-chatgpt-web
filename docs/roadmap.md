# goose-chatgpt-web roadmap

This file is the durable handoff for the next implementation steps. Keep it concise and update it when a milestone materially changes.

## Completed milestone — first real Goose-owned tool round trip

Status as of 2026-08-08: **PASS.** The first real end-to-end Goose-owned tool round trip succeeded (trace `c57eb8d02ba2`): ordinary Goose → `goose-chatgpt-web` standalone full mode → authenticated ChatGPT Web → `Codex Native` connector/tunnel → real Goose-owned MCP tool (`get_proof_nonce`) → matching `function_call_output` resumed the same active browser response → ChatGPT returned the exact unpredictable nonce → Goose displayed it. Exactly one ChatGPT-Web browser turn was created for the successful attempt.

- `setup --full --standalone` is implemented and proven live with the tunnel runtime, MCP broker, authenticated ChatGPT Web path, and a real Goose-owned tool.
- The bridge returns a standard Responses `function_call`; Goose remains the tool executor; the matching `function_call_output` is delivered through `broker.completeTool(...)` into the same active `ChatGptTurnSession`; the bridge does not execute the Goose tool itself.
- Standalone Goose supplies no trusted native-Codex cwd/sandbox authority. The bridge therefore carries only Goose's currently advertised tool registry and leaves cwd/sandbox authority absent rather than fabricating it; the native Codex environment store remains fail-closed.
- The clean proof used `autoApproveToolCalls` for ChatGPT's per-call connector confirmation and `GOOSE_DISABLE_SESSION_NAMING=true` so Goose did not generate a second concurrent provider/browser turn merely to name the session.
- Goose auxiliary model calls can multiply ChatGPT-Web traffic. Goose 1.45.0 session naming generated a second concurrent ChatGPT browser turn during proof testing. The ChatGPT-Web path should initially run with `GOOSE_DISABLE_SESSION_NAMING=true`. No separate per-tool-call LLM summary request was found in Goose 1.45.0.
- Earlier attempts surfaced a confirmed ChatGPT-side `Too many requests` / 429 condition and, separately, a send-stage acknowledgement timeout while Goose was launching two concurrent browser turns. The send-stage failure was **not** directly confirmed as a 429; current send-stage polling does not invoke the existing rate-limit-dialog detector, so keep that diagnostic gap as a later reliability concern rather than treating the timeout itself as proof of throttling.
- During an earlier cleanup, forcibly killing Playwright/Chrome exposed a stale-browser-handle failure (`Target page, context or browser has been closed`); a clean daemon/service restart (not `pkill -9`) discards the stale handle and lets the browser worker reacquire a fresh one. See the stale-browser-recovery follow-up below.
- Local validation before merge: `bun test tests/*.test.ts` — 262 passed, 0 failed; `bunx tsc --noEmit` — clean. A bounded free-code-worker review found no confirmed defects, and an independent PR review found no blocking code issue.

Closure: implementation, live proof, local validation, scope review, and independent review are complete. PR #3 is the merge vehicle for this milestone. After it is merged, continue from the next milestone in fresh ChatGPT and Goose sessions.

## Next milestone — browser UX and reliability

Status as of 2026-08-08: **PASS (fallback #2).** Three mechanisms were tried in order:

1. Headless by default (`agent/managed-chrome-headless-default`, draft PR #4, not merged) — **blocked**: `chatgpt.com` serves a Cloudflare `Just a moment...` bot-check to Playwright's headless Chromium and never exposes the composer, even with the identical stored session that succeeds headed. Do not revisit without a validated anti-detection change; this repo does not do Cloudflare-bypass work.
2. Headed without activation/focus theft — **blocked**: a deterministic `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication` A/B test showed Chrome always activates and steals macOS keyboard focus the instant it shows any real window/tab (confirmed via `chromium.launch()`, via macOS `open -g` non-activating launch, and via a raw CDP `Target.createTarget` call with no Playwright involved at all — all three activate). No Chromium command-line switch suppresses it.
3. Headed, immediately minimized — **implemented**. `pageForNewTurn()` in `src/adapters/chatgpt-web/browser-worker.ts` now minimizes each new managed-Chrome window immediately after creation via CDP `Browser.getWindowForTarget` + `Browser.setWindowBounds({windowState: "minimized"})`, gated on `config.headed` (headless and `launcher` browser-host turns are unaffected; interactive `loginToChatGpt` is untouched and stays visible). Live A/B testing (`NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication` timeline, 4 runs including one real authenticated ChatGPT turn) showed Chrome activates for roughly 2–3 seconds after each new window, then focus reliably returns to the previously-frontmost app on its own; the real ChatGPT composer became reachable and Goose automation continued to work normally while the window stayed minimized for the rest of the turn.

Follow-ups:

- The ~2–3s activation window at turn start is a known, bounded limitation of this fallback, not eliminated by it; do not attempt further focus-suppression tricks without new evidence.

## Completed milestone — bounded browser-reliability follow-ups

Status as of 2026-08-08: **PASS.**

- Stale managed-browser recovery: `ensureManagedBrowser()` in `src/adapters/chatgpt-web/browser-worker.ts` now checks `browser.isConnected()` and `!context.isClosed()` before reusing the cached handle; a dead one is discarded (no process killing — just dropping the reference) and a fresh browser is acquired instead of surfacing `Target page, context or browser has been closed`. Bounded: one check, one relaunch attempt, no retry loop. Live-validated: the cached managed Chrome process was killed with a single targeted `kill -TERM` (not a broad kill), and the next turn transparently acquired a fresh browser and reached `composer_ready` successfully — no stale-handle error surfaced.
- Send-stage 429 detection: `waitForSubmissionAccepted()` now also calls the existing `throwIfChatGptRateLimitDialog()` on every poll, so a rate-limit dialog appearing after submission surfaces as an explicit `429`/`rate_limit_error` instead of degrading into a generic send-stage timeout. Covered by a focused test (dialog visible ⇒ explicit 429, not a hang); a real live 429 was not forced, since reliably reproducing ChatGPT's actual rate limit requires abusive rapid-fire requests, which is out of scope.
- Minimum browser-surface count re-confirmed with `GOOSE_DISABLE_SESSION_NAMING=true`: one ordinary Goose request produced exactly one managed Chrome process and exactly one ChatGPT browser turn, end to end to a correct reply.
- No retry/backoff logic was added — 429 handling stays conservative by construction (surface once, explicitly, and stop; a confirmed 429 should still only ever get a very low retry cap with no rapid retry loop if retry logic is added later).
- Local validation: `bun test tests/*.test.ts` — 273 passed, 0 failed; `bunx tsc --noEmit` — clean.

Previously discovered, explicitly not fixed in this milestone: a "wedged but technically connected" cached-browser handle (`isConnected() === true` / `!isClosed()` yet `context.newPage()` hangs) after `service cancel-turns` aborts a turn mid stage-timeout. Fixed in the next milestone below.

## Completed milestone — connected-but-wedged managed-browser liveness probe

Status as of 2026-08-09: **PASS.**

- Root cause: `service cancel-turns` aborts the `AbortController`/timeout race in `runStage()`, but the underlying in-flight Playwright/CDP call is not itself cancelled — it keeps running against the real browser process. If that leaves the browser's CDP message handling backed up (e.g. mid an unrelated `session_verification` DOM stall), the WebSocket transport stays open (`isConnected() === true`) and the context is never explicitly closed (`!isClosed()`), but the browser stops answering CDP commands. Both existing checks are local flags, not round trips, so they cannot see this; the next `context.newPage()` then hangs for the full stage timeout instead of failing fast.
- Fix: `ensureManagedBrowser()` in `src/adapters/chatgpt-web/browser-worker.ts` now also runs `isManagedBrowserConnectionLive()` before trusting a cached connection — a bounded (`MANAGED_BROWSER_LIVENESS_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS` = 3s), real `context.cookies()` CDP round trip (`Storage.getCookies`), chosen because it's the cheapest real round trip `BrowserContext` exposes with no visible side effect and no page required. On timeout or rejection the cached browser/context is discarded exactly like the existing dead-handle path (no process killing) and a fresh managed browser is acquired on the same call. One probe, no retry loop.
- Live-validated with a real Chrome process and the real stored login state (in-process, calling `ensureManagedBrowser()` directly against the real config, bypassing HTTP): call 1 launched a fresh managed Chrome; call 2 reused it via a healthy ~7ms liveness round trip; `SIGSTOP` on that Chrome process reproduced the exact "connected but wedged" symptom (`isConnected()` still `true`, no CDP responses); call 3 detected the wedge (bounded ~3s probe timeout), discarded the stale handle, and transparently relaunched a fresh managed Chrome (~5.1s total) — no daemon restart; call 4 confirmed the newly recovered browser became the healthy cached one. The real daemon service was restarted once to load the new code (not as part of the recovery mechanism itself) and came back up healthy.
- Not re-validated live in this milestone: the "one ordinary Goose turn creates exactly one browser surface with `GOOSE_DISABLE_SESSION_NAMING=true`" regression check from the prior milestone. The real `codex` CLI binary (required for the `codex-acp`/"Codex Native" route this repo hijacks via `route connect`) is not installed in this environment, and installing it plus mutating the shared global `~/.codex/config.toml` was judged disproportionate for a change that does not touch turn-creation, browser-surface counting, or session-naming logic at all — only the internal cached-connection liveness check inside `ensureManagedBrowser()`. Re-run that specific check if this environment gains a working `codex` CLI.
- Local validation: `bun test tests/*.test.ts` — 278 passed, 0 failed; `bunx tsc --noEmit` — clean.

## Completed milestone — ChatGPT-Web as ordinary Goose's main provider

Status as of 2026-08-09: **PASS.** Ordinary Goose (the real Goose Desktop/CLI at `/Applications/Goose.app`, not a scratch script) is cut over to ChatGPT Web as its normal main model, with Claude ACP and Codex ACP left fully configured as fallbacks.

- Goose 1.45.0 has no built-in provider that speaks the Responses API to a custom host — the plain `openai` provider is hardcoded to `v1/chat/completions`, and `chatgpt_codex` is hardcoded to `https://chatgpt.com`. The actual mechanism is Goose's **custom provider** feature (`goose configure` → `Custom Providers` → `Add A Custom Provider` → `OpenAI Compatible`, or the underlying `~/.config/goose/custom_providers/*.json`): `engine: "openai"` with `base_path: "v1/responses"` and `base_url` pointing at the daemon's loopback port. `requires_auth: false` since the bridge does not check the Responses endpoint's bearer. This created `custom_chatgpt_web__local_1` (`~/.config/goose/config.yaml`, `active_provider: custom_chatgpt_web__local_1`, model `chatgpt-web/medium`), and is now the durable, documented way to point ordinary Goose at this bridge — `providers.openai` in `config.yaml` is not it and does not work.
- Found and fixed a real bug blocking every tool-calling round trip through this path: standalone Goose re-stamps a live `<turn-context><current-time>...</current-time>...</turn-context>` block into the resent user message on every provider round, including the follow-up request that carries the `function_call_output` for the same logical turn. `tagStandaloneIdentity`'s digest and `extractChatGptTurnUserRevision` both hashed that raw content, so any tool round trip crossing a wall-clock minute (effort selection alone regularly takes ~20s) produced a different standalone identity for the follow-up request than the original — missing the existing `ChatGptTurnSession`, so the follow-up silently opened a second, independent browser turn instead of resuming the first. Fixed by stripping the volatile `<turn-context>` block before hashing (`stripVolatileTurnContextParts` in `src/adapters/chatgpt-web/environment.ts`, used by both `extractChatGptTurnUserRevision` and a new `standaloneIdentityPrefix` in `src/server.ts`). `bun test tests/*.test.ts` — 278 passed, 0 failed; `bunx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- Live-validated end-to-end with the real Goose CLI (`goose run`), the real standalone `full` daemon (`~/.goose-chatgpt-web-dev`, mode `full`, `standalone: true`), and a real Goose-owned MCP tool (`--with-extension` running `scripts/proof-mcp-server.ts`'s `get_proof_nonce`, exposed as `bun__get_proof_nonce`): exactly one browser turn was created (trace `f6f319dce72c`), the tool call was queued/delivered/completed on that same trace, and ChatGPT relayed the exact unpredictable nonce back into the same turn, which Goose displayed correctly. `GOOSE_DISABLE_SESSION_NAMING=true` is set durably in `config.yaml`.
- ChatGPT's own MCP connector intermittently declines a tool call with "This tool call was blocked by OpenAI because we couldn't determine the safety status of the request" or silently skips the call ("No value was returned."), on requests that are otherwise identical to ones that succeed. Observed on 2 of 4 fresh-identity attempts in one session; not something this bridge controls (it is ChatGPT's own connector-side gate on the `autoApproveToolCalls` auto-click), so treat tool-calling turns as retriable rather than guaranteed-first-try.
- Not re-validated: `doctor`'s tunnel-readiness check is unreliable — it reported "Tunnel runtime is not ready" / a stale `OnStop` log line even immediately after a successful `tunnel restart`, while the tunnel's own health endpoint and real browser/tool traffic were actually healthy. Don't trust `doctor`'s tunnel section as a go/no-go signal without also checking `curl $(cat "~/Library/Application Support/tunnel-client/health/codex-chatgpt-web.url")`.

## Completed milestone — connector-identity and action-permission reconciliation

Status as of 2026-08-09: **PASS.**

- Root cause confirmed: this fork's ChatGPT connector was still bound to the legacy `Codex Native`
  identity and its pre-v4 two-step `codex_bind_turn` → `binding_id` MCP contract. ChatGPT caches a
  connector's public MCP contract, including its granted action-permission level, by connector
  identity. Because that identity predates Goose's tool set (`shell`, `tree`, `analyze`, `load`,
  `delegate`, all routed through the maximally-gated `codex_tool_call`), ChatGPT was enforcing a
  stale, insufficient permission grant and blocking those calls with its own action-safety layer
  before Goose ever executed them — matching upstream `miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web`'s v2.1.0 "direct
  Codex harness bridge" release, which hit and fixed the identical class of problem.
- Adopted from upstream: the connector-identity module pattern (`CHATGPT_CONNECTOR_NAME`,
  `LEGACY_CHATGPT_CONNECTOR_NAMES`, `resolveSetupConnectorName`, fail-closed migration errors in
  setup and the browser worker) and the v4 direct turn-token MCP contract (every `codex_*` tool now
  takes `turn_token` directly; `codex_bind_turn`/`binding_id` are removed, since the broker's
  `claim` method was already idempotent per token).
- Adapted for this fork: the fresh identity is `Goose Native` (not upstream's `Codex Native2`),
  since this fork's outer harness is standalone Goose as well as Codex; `harnessLabel` and the new
  `connectorName` prompt parameter stay independently parameterized so the transport-contract text
  names the actual configured connector and the actual outer harness. Goose-owned tool execution,
  sandboxing, and approval are untouched — this change only affects how ChatGPT is told to reach the
  MCP bridge, never who executes a tool once ChatGPT calls it.
- Local validation: `bun test tests/*.test.ts` and `bunx tsc --noEmit` (see PR for exact counts).
- Not live-validated in this milestone: the actual ChatGPT-side connector recreation and "Allow all
  actions" grant require a manual step in Luke's ChatGPT account (see the PR description for exact
  connector name, tunnel, authentication, and permission settings), followed by one live Goose tool
  round trip through the new connector.

## Then — reconcile with remaining upstream work

Before adding more architecture, keep inspecting the current `miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web` delta from
this fork's base and reuse upstream fixes where possible.

Pay particular attention to newer upstream work around:

- rate-limit handling;
- model/runtime changes (e.g. upstream's `solAvailable`/Sol-Luna model catalog, not yet reviewed for
  relevance to this fork);
- browser/runtime reliability;
- any changes that would supersede custom work in this fork.

Do not independently rebuild functionality that upstream already provides cleanly.

## Then — continue the core Goose architecture

Only after upstream reconciliation:

- choose and verify the strongest tool-capable ChatGPT-Web tier suitable as the normal Goose model;
- investigate persistent ChatGPT browser conversation reuse across separate user turns, while Goose remains the canonical durable conversation history;
- broaden Goose-owned tool coverage only after the single-tool lifecycle is solid;
- then revisit Day Shift orchestration, free-worker delegation, provider routing and related refinements.

## Boundaries

- `goose-chatgpt-web` owns ChatGPT Web transport and Goose provider compatibility.
- Day Shift remains a separate orchestration/policy project.
- Reuse Goose-native and upstream mechanisms before creating new orchestration layers.
- Never commit credentials, browser auth state, `.env`, runtime keys or other secrets.
- Keep implementation work on feature branches and draft PRs; no merge without explicit approval.
