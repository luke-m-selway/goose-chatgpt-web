# Documentation map

This directory is the authoritative handoff for the current Goose-first runtime and the next active project milestone.

## Status labels

- **current/proven** — implemented and exercised against the named/current revision; safe to use as the present operating contract.
- **active** — the next implementation milestone; design decisions are current, but implementation/proof is not complete yet.
- **provisional** — a current design detail that still has an explicitly named proof or decision outstanding.
- **deferred** — intentionally later work, not a first-proof requirement.
- **historical** — superseded engineering evidence retained in Git/old PRs; not an operating instruction.

## Current/proven runtime documentation

- [`../README.md`](../README.md) — current project shape and status.
- [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) — ownership and request/tool flow.
- [`runtime-lifecycle.md`](runtime-lifecycle.md) — canonical lifecycle, BrowserHost readiness, macOS autostart, and remaining reboot proof.
- [`chatgpt-web-flight-recorder.md`](chatgpt-web-flight-recorder.md) — optional passive trace, transport, broker, retry, and Electron-native screenshot evidence for ordinary use.
- [`security-model.md`](security-model.md) — current trust/capability boundaries.
- [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — mandatory runtime/safety rules for agents.

The proven lifecycle/autostart base remains Electron checkpoint `c624274` plus current-main autostart
commit `dd44b74`. Draft PR #31's development runtime is separately deployed at
`f54ba39305a6e6a101aa599db1409ab46b9666a1`, with passive observation enabled; that deployment does
not upgrade parent-plus-two-child completion reliability to proven status.

## Active reliability checkpoint

- [`chatgpt-web-concurrency-qualification.md`](chatgpt-web-concurrency-qualification.md) records the
  current Electron-native liveness qualification status. A genuine parent plus two async
  ChatGPT-Web child topology and genuine three-surface overlap are established. Reliable completion
  remains **NOT QUALIFIED**. Passive flight recording is active for ordinary single-agent and
  naturally delegated use; another designated synthetic run is not the current next action.
- [`chatgpt-web-flight-recorder.md`](chatgpt-web-flight-recorder.md) documents the active passive
  observation phase and its privacy/storage boundaries.

## Next feature milestone

- [`goose-control-plan.md`](goose-control-plan.md) — Goose Control is the next active milestone. Its backend is settled on authenticated loopback Goose ACP; its first Planner-facing proof is a private GPT Action calling a narrow authenticated HTTPS REST/OpenAPI facade.
- [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) — current and next work only.

## Provisional / not yet proven

The actual Mac **reboot/login → automatic reconstruction → ordinary Goose first turn → separate dependent `--resume`** proof has not been run. Ordered autostart is implemented and live-checked without that reboot boundary.

Reliable parent-plus-two-child completion remains unqualified despite established topology and
overlap. Ordinary-use passive evidence is the chosen next qualification phase.

No document may silently upgrade that item to proven status.

## Deferred

For Goose Control, asynchronous `submit_task → job_id → get_job`, cancellation, multi-target registries, approved fresh-session creation, and a persistent Orchestrator/Palmate layer are later phases. They are not requirements for the first synchronous continuation proof.

## Historical/design inputs

- Draft PR #25 refined Goose Control around native ACP and remains useful design evidence, but its write-capable custom-MCP-first Planner surface and async-first MVP are superseded by the current `goose-control-plan.md`.
- Draft PR #26 proposed a useful documentation split and lifecycle clarification, but its pre-autostart provisional runtime status is superseded by current `main` plus this reconciliation.
- The previous long chronological roadmap remains available in Git history at `dd44b74`; use it for archaeology only, not for current priorities or lifecycle instructions.

When historical material conflicts with current code/proofs and the current documents above, use the current documents.
